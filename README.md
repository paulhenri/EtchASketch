# EtchASketch
My attemp for the Odin Project 'ETCH-A-SKETCH' [Link to the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

Nothing fancy here - The only "bonus" is the color of the grid being colored : it is generated as an HSL value to get a pastel color.
The script works up to 100 * 100 grid.
